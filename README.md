Details of files contained in this repository:
* titanic_train.csv: This is the file which contitues the dataset.

There are various detailed graphs and charts in the notebook and the HTMl file pertaining to the analysis of the wreck.

I have used two models, namely:

  1) Random Forest Classification Algorithm.
  2) Linear Discrimination Analysis.
